# Svorm

https://svorm.netlify.app

This app is similar to Google Forms. It lets you create forms - called _svorms_. Questions can be either simple questions or multiple choice questions. Once a svorm is created, it can be shared with others who can answer it. The results can also be seen.

This app is made with SvelteKit, and the database is hosted on Supabase. See [database.md](database.md) for a documentation of the database.
